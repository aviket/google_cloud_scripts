# üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps Tile Downloader & Mosaic Stitcher (GUI)

This Python application allows you to download static tiles from Google Maps within a specified bounding box, and stitch them together into a high-resolution mosaic. The GUI is built using **PyQt6**, and image processing is handled with **Pillow (PIL)**.

## üöÄ Features

- GUI-based interface using PyQt6
- Define a bounding box (north/south/east/west) for tile coverage
- Set Google Maps zoom level (1‚Äì21)
- Use your own **Google Maps Static API Key**
- Choose output folder and mosaic filename prefix (Area ID)
- Optional: Toggle Google Map labels (e.g. road names, place names)
- Live **progress bar** during tile download and stitching
- Final stitched mosaic saved as `mosaic.png`

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Overview

| UI Element           | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| **North/South Latitude** | Define vertical bounds |
| **East/West Longitude** | Define horizontal bounds |
| **Zoom Level**       | Controls tile resolution |
| **API Key**          | Required for downloading tiles |
| **Area ID**          | Prefix used in filenames |
| **Output Folder**    | Save location for tiles and mosaic |
| **Hide Labels**      | Option to hide map labels in tiles |
| **Download Tiles**   | Starts tile download process |
| **Stitch Mosaic**    | Assembles downloaded tiles into a single image |

## üì¶ Requirements

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 Pillow requests
```

---

## üîß Google Maps API Setup

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the **Maps Static API**
3. Generate an **API Key**
4. Copy and paste your API key into the application

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
python map_tile_gui.py
```

Replace `map_tile_gui.py` with the filename you saved this script as.

---

## üß© Output

- Individual tiles are saved as: `AreaID_col,row.png` (e.g. `Mumbai_0,0.png`)
- Final mosaic is saved as: `mosaic.png` in the selected folder
- Tile metadata is logged in `tiles_log.csv`
